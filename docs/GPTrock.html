        <h3> Write a rock and roll song protesting the Vietnam War.</h3>
        <br/>
        <p> Verse 1:</p>
        <p> They sent me to a foreign land</p>
        <p> With a gun in my hand</p>
        <p> Told me to fight for freedom</p>
        <p> But it just wasn't what it seemed</p>
        <p> I saw the pain and the fear</p>
        <p> In the eyes of those we killed</p>
        <p> And I wondered what we were fighting for</p>
        <p> As the bombs kept dropping more</p>
        <br />
        <p> Chorus:</p>
        <p> War, what is it good for?</p>
        <p> Absolutely nothing</p>
        <p> Say it again, y'all</p>
        <p> War, what is it good for?</p>
        <p> Absolutely nothing</p>
        <br />
        <p> Verse 2:</p>
        <p> I lost friends along the way</p>
        <p> In that senseless war they made</p>
        <p> And I don't know how to reconcile</p>
        <p> All the things that I saw and felt</p>
        <p> But I know we can't stay silent</p>
        <p> We can't let it go on like this</p>
        <p> We've got to stand up and fight</p>
        <p> For what's right, for human life</p>
        <br />
        <p> Chorus:</p>
        <p> War, what is it good for?</p>
        <p> Absolutely nothing</p>
        <p> Say it again, y'all</p>
        <p> War, what is it good for?</p>
        <p> Absolutely nothing</p>
        <br />
        <p> Bridge:</p>
        <p> We can't keep living in fear</p>
        <p> We can't let them control us, dear</p>
        <p> It's time to rise up, take a stand</p>
        <p> And make our voices heard in this land</p>
        <br />
        <p> Chorus:</p>
        <p> War, what is it good for?</p>
        <p> Absolutely nothing</p>
        <p> Say it again, y'all</p>
        <p> War, what is it good for?</p>
        <p> Absolutely nothing</p>
        <br />
        <p> Outro:</p>
        <p> We'll keep fighting for peace</p>
        <p> Until all wars cease</p>
        <p> No more lives will be lost</p>
        <p> We'll pay the ultimate cost.</p>

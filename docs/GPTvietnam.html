        <h3> Write a song protesting the Vietnam War.</h3>
        <br/>
        <p> Verse 1:</p>
        <p> I'm tired of all this fighting</p>
        <p> I'm tired of all this hate</p>
        <p> I'm tired of all this killing</p>
        <p> And all the lives it takes</p>
        <p> The bombs keep dropping down</p>
        <p> And the tears keep falling too</p>
        <p> But I won't stay silent now</p>
        <p> I'll raise my voice for what's true</p>
        <br/>
        <p> Chorus:</p>
        <p> No more war, no more pain</p>
        <p> We won't let it happen again</p>
        <p> We'll fight for peace, we'll fight for love</p>
        <p> We'll rise up, we'll rise above</p>
        <br/>
        <p> Verse 2:</p>
        <p> They tell us we must fight</p>
        <p> For freedom and for rights</p>
        <p> But how can we be free</p>
        <p> When our brothers and sisters die</p>
        <p> We've seen the horrors of war</p>
        <p> And we know what it can do</p>
        <p> It's time to end this madness</p>
        <p> And start something new</p>
        <br/>
        <p> Chorus:</p>
        <p> No more war, no more pain</p>
        <p> We won't let it happen again</p>
        <p> We'll fight for peace, we'll fight for love</p>
        <p> We'll rise up, we'll rise above</p>
        <br/>
        <p> Bridge:</p>
        <p> It's time to lay down our guns</p>
        <p> And see the light of the sun</p>
        <p> Let's come together as one</p>
        <p> And let love overcome</p>
        <br/>
        <p> Chorus:</p>
        <p> No more war, no more pain</p>
        <p> We won't let it happen again</p>
        <p> We'll fight for peace, we'll fight for love</p>
        <p> We'll rise up, we'll rise above</p>
        <br/>
        <p> Outro:</p>
        <p> The war will end someday</p>
        <p> And we'll look back and say</p>
        <p> We stood up for what's right</p>
        <p> And we won the fight for life.</p>
        <br/>
